              <h5>Goal:</h5><p>The aim of this incubator project was to help cultural heritage institutions find the right software solution for organising and presenting their artefacts. To this end, we have developed a decision-making aid comprising two complementary DMP templates. One template is designed from the user's perspective (i.e. collections) to help clarify their requirements and assist in selecting suitable software for collection management. The other template enables collection management products to be described in detail from the provider's perspective, making them comparable for users. This facilitates a matching between software products and users.</p>

              <h5>Goal:</h5><p>The product of this incubator project is a DMP template to help museums and collections implement the FAIR principles. The template provides an accessible option for assessing the FAIR quality of collection data. The questions are categorised according to four typical processing phases: digitisation, documentation, publication and storage/archiving. Most of the questions within these categories are assigned to indicators from the FAIR Data Maturity Model. The template includes answer options, some recommendations for action, help texts, notes and links to useful materials. The aim is to create a template that illustrates the different levels of FAIR implementation, while also providing institutions with a roadmap to improve the quality of their data.</p>

              <h5>Goal:</h5><p>The institutions involved in Text+ advise researchers on all steps of the systematic organisation of their research data. Thus, Text+ offers its community a question catalogue for structured planning, which is provided by the eResearch Alliance of the University of Göttingen (access via GRO.Plan, access with Academic ID). Based on the RDMO standard catalogue and the question catalogue of the Max Weber Foundation, the Text+ catalogue was adapted accordingly in collaboration with participants of the consortium, based on the removal of irrelevant questions, the enrichment with subject-specific examples and the integration of suitable plugins. In this incubator project, the compatibility between the Text+ catalogue and the NFDI question catalogue will be ensured, specifying and adjusting the places where the Text+ catalogue is still too generic.</p>
